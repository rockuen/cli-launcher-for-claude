# Changelog

## [3.0.0] - 2026-04-26

### OMC integration arc — major chapter restart

After the brief Podium fork was archived, active development returned to this repo
and shipped the OMC integration as additive features on top of the v2.6.6 launcher.
None of the v2.6.x behavior was removed. The v3.0 number reflects the surface area
added (TS toolchain, multi-backend terminal, OMC-gated UI), not breaking changes.

#### Added — toolchain (Phase 0)
- TypeScript + esbuild + `node:test` build pipeline.
- `vscode` engine bumped to `^1.85.0`.

#### Added — multiplexer abstraction (Phase 1, 6, 9, 12)
- `IMultiplexerBackend` + `TmuxBackend` (Mac/Linux) + `PsmuxBackend` (Windows).
- New settings: `terminal.defaultBackend`, `terminal.multiplexerLifecycle`,
  `multiplexer.preferred`.
- Smart `Open Claude Code (use default backend)` wrapper drives keybinding +
  editor title icon. Explicit *Open Claude Code* (Webview) and *Open Claude Code
  in tmux/psmux* commands stay in the palette for per-action overrides.
- In-place multiplexer mode: same Webview tab, multiplexer client inside.
- `kill-on-close` lifecycle (default) avoids zombie sessions; `detached` for
  external attach workflows; *Clean Up Detached Multiplexer Sessions* command.
- Silent Webview fallback when no multiplexer binary is on PATH.

#### Added — OMC mode (Phase 3, 4)
- `OMCRuntime.detectOMC()` two-of-three majority detection.
- `claudeCodeLauncher.omcModeActive` context key + *Enter / Exit OMC Mode*.
- One-time onboarding info message when OMC is detected.

#### Added — CCG tri-model viewer (Phase 5)
- Sidebar tree of every `/ccg` artifact pair (`.omc/artifacts/ask/`).
- Per-pair Webview comparison panel (~10 KB esbuild bundle).
- Commands: *Show CCG*, *Refresh CCG*, *Open CCG Pair*, *Rerun CCG* (OMC-gated).

#### Added — HUD status bar (Phase 7)
- `<workspace>/.omc/state/hud-stdin-cache.json` watcher.
- Status bar pill: model / context % / total cost / 5-hour rate-limit %.
- *Show HUD Snapshot* dumps the live JSON to the orchestration output channel.

#### Added — file-path UX (Phase 11)
- Brace expansion in *Open File* / *Open Folder* handlers — patterns like
  `worker-{1,2,3}/answer.md` open every alternative in one click.

#### Added — nested session groups (Phase 13 + hotfixes)
- Sub-folder support up to depth 3 (e.g. `Work/Backend/API`).
- *Add Sub-Group* + *New Sub-Group…* in *Move to Group…* picker.
- *Rename Group* migrates every descendant path prefix automatically.
- *Delete Group* removes self + descendants behind a confirm dialog.
- Single-segment groups continue to work identically (zero regression).

#### Added — per-session backend override (Phase 10)
- *Resume in Webview* / *Resume in tmux/psmux* on the right-click menu of any
  saved session.
- IDE-startup auto-restore respects `terminal.defaultBackend`.

#### Added — in-app settings (Phase 8b, 12)
- *Default Terminal* and *Multiplexer Lifecycle* dropdowns in the launcher's
  gear modal — same dotted keys as the host Settings UI.

#### Fixed
- `colors.ts`/`HUD` modules split so unit tests don't need a vscode mock.
- Editor title button regained its Claude robot icon after Phase 8 hand-off.
- Empty sub-group `null` dereference in the tree builder (Phase 13 hotfix).
- Sub-group disappear-on-move where moving the last session out of a root
  group emptied the path key and lost both root and sub-group from the
  tree — preserve key + render-time ancestor synthesis (Phase 13 hotfix-2).

#### Background
This release closes the cli-launcher → Podium → cli-launcher round-trip.
The Podium fork is archived at v0.16.0; OMC features now live here as
opt-in extensions of the launcher rather than a separate product.

## [2.7.25] - 2026-04-22

### Final Deprecation Release

This release marks the **end of `rockuen.cli-launcher-for-claude`**. The extension has been rebranded and continues as **Podium CLI Launcher for Claude** — please install the new extension for future updates:

- **New GitHub repo**: https://github.com/rockuen/podium
- **New Open VSX listing**: `rockuen.podium`
- **Migration**: VSCode/Antigravity has no automatic upgrade path between different extension IDs. Uninstall `rockuen.cli-launcher-for-claude` and install `rockuen.podium` manually.

### Content

The functional content of v2.7.25 is **identical to v2.6.6** (stable launcher, no Podium orchestration). Intermediate versions v2.6.7 through v2.7.24 were WIP integration builds now superseded by the Podium rebrand and no longer distributed here.

## [2.6.6] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Interactive prompt detection — fast-path to needs-attention** — When the PTY emits a Claude CLI confirmation prompt ("Do you want to…", "[Y/n]", "Press Enter to continue…", etc.), the tab now flips to `needs-attention` immediately instead of waiting out the 7-second running threshold. Brief prompts that finished setup in 2 seconds and silently sat asking for a Yes/No no longer go unnoticed.
- **Tab title blink while needs-attention** — The webview tab title prefixes a `⚠` glyph that flashes every 800 ms whenever the tab is unfocused **and** in `needs-attention` state. Self-stops when you focus the tab, when the state transitions away, or when the panel is disposed. Combined with the existing desktop notification + status bar prominent background, the tab is now genuinely hard to miss when Claude is waiting for an answer.

## [2.6.5] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Reorder custom buttons in settings** — Each custom button row in the Settings → Custom Buttons list now has ▲/▼ arrows next to the delete X. Click to swap with the adjacent row. The top row's ▲ and the bottom row's ▼ are hidden so you always know what will happen. Order is persisted to `customButtons` and reloads into the toolbar on the next window reload.
- **Edit custom buttons in place** — Click the label or command text of any custom button row to turn it into an inline input. Enter commits the edit, Escape cancels, blur commits. No separate edit dialog — same hover affordance pattern as the delete X and the new move arrows.
- **Auto /effort max on first idle** — Optional toggle in Settings. When on, each session automatically sends `/effort max` the first time it reaches an idle state after startup. Useful when Reload Window restores many resume-later sessions and you want them all back on max effort without visiting each tab. Off by default. Fires once per session — manually changing the effort later is not overridden.

### Changed
- **Smooth wheel scroll in normal mode** — Enabled xterm.js `smoothScrollDuration: 120` so wheel scrolling over the scrollback buffer glides between frames instead of jumping line-by-line. Applies only to xterm's native scroll API path (normal buffer with scrollback), so fullscreen TUI mode is unaffected — the TUI (Claude CLI) still drives its own partial redraws there, and any fake CSS smoothing would collide with partial frame updates and re-introduce ghost artifacts.

## [2.6.4] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Redraw screen — recover from fullscreen rendering corruption without losing context** — Wheel scrolling in Claude CLI's fullscreen TUI sometimes leaves overlapping text or ghost lines behind (the TUI's partial-redraw pipeline doesn't always flush its frame buffer cleanly). Added a `↻` button in the toolbar (visible only while alternate screen is active) and a `Ctrl+Shift+R` shortcut that trigger a full redraw. Mechanism: webview repaints xterm via `term.refresh()`, then the extension toggles the PTY size by 1 column and back — Claude CLI receives two SIGWINCH signals and redraws from scratch. Unlike `/clear` or `/compact`, **no session, scrollback, or conversation state is touched** — it's a purely visual refresh.

## [2.6.3] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- **FS mode stuck detecting fullscreen when Claude CLI isn't in it — wheel scroll broken** — The mouse-mode tracking flag was kept alive by the enable/disable escape sequences alone. If Claude ever failed to emit the disable sequence on TUI exit (or a write-chunk boundary sliced the sequence and broke our regex), `isMouseMode` stayed `true` indefinitely, hijacking wheel events into SGR reports that the non-fullscreen Claude CLI couldn't consume. Now wheel forwarding requires **both** `isAlternateScreen` (authoritative via `term.buffer.onBufferChange`) **and** `isMouseMode`, and any return to the normal screen buffer force-clears the mouse-mode flag.

### Added
- **Click FS indicator to force normal mode** — Escape hatch for rare cases where detection is still wrong. Clicking the amber `FS` badge in the toolbar toggles a user override: the badge turns grey, strikes through (`FS×`), and the terminal behaves as if fullscreen were off — wheel scrolls locally, drag/copy work as usual. Click again to return to auto-detect. The override auto-clears when the buffer returns to normal, so you don't have to remember to toggle it back.

## [2.6.2] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- **Ctrl+C still forwarded to PTY after copy (leaking ^C to Claude CLI exit prep)** — The v2.6.1 document-level Ctrl+C handler correctly did the clipboard copy, but it also naively skipped all `<textarea>` targets to preserve native input copy. xterm.js uses a hidden `xterm-helper-textarea` to capture keyboard input, so focus inside the terminal classified as TEXTAREA → the handler skipped → xterm's internal processing forwarded ^C to the PTY. Claude CLI then started its "Press Ctrl+C again to exit" countdown even though the copy had succeeded. Now we detect xterm's internal textarea by checking `#terminal.contains(e.target)` and always proceed with copy in that case, only bailing for real user-facing inputs. Added `stopImmediatePropagation()` and restored a selection-guard inside `attachCustomKeyEventHandler` (returns `false` when selection exists) as belt-and-suspenders protection.
- **Open Folder failed for partial/nested paths** — `handleOpenFile` had a basename-search fallback that walked the cwd tree up to depth 6 to locate files like `slack-manifests/01-demand-forecast.yaml`, but `handleOpenFolder` skipped this branch and just errored out when the first resolve attempt failed. Mirrored the same fallback so selecting a relative file path and choosing "Open Folder" now finds the file anywhere in the workspace tree and opens its containing directory in the OS file explorer.

## [2.6.1] - 2026-04-16

### Changed
- **Context indicator click → `/compact`** — Clicking the toolbar context-usage bar used to re-query usage via `/context`. But usage already updates automatically from output, so the click was most often used when the bar entered the danger zone and the user wanted to compact anyway. One less command to type.

### Fixed
- **Ctrl+C copy unreliable after drag-select** — `attachCustomKeyEventHandler` only fires when xterm's internal textarea has focus, but drag-to-select in fullscreen/alternate-screen mode can leave focus on the viewport div instead. Moved the Ctrl+C copy logic to a document-level capture-phase listener so it runs regardless of which element inside the webview holds focus. Real `<input>`/`<textarea>` targets are skipped so native input-field copy still works, and the "send ^C to PTY when no selection" path is preserved (non-handled events fall through to xterm's default).

## [2.6.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **Custom session sorting** — Sessions within a group (or at top level in Recent Sessions) can now be reordered manually. Two methods: (1) right-click → "Move Up" / "Move Down" for precise adjustments, (2) drag-and-drop for direct positioning. Sort order is persisted in `claudeSessionSortOrder` and takes precedence over the default mtime-based order.
- **2-level session nesting** — Sessions can now contain sub-sessions for hierarchical organization. Right-click a top-level session → "Nest Under Session..." → pick a parent from the QuickPick. Maximum depth is 2 (Group → Session → Sub-session). Sub-sessions appear indented under their parent regardless of their own group membership. Use "Unnest (Move to Top Level)" on a sub-session to flatten it back.
- **Drag & drop session management** — Drag a session onto a custom group → moves it there. Drag onto another session → inserts it right before the target, inheriting the target's group and parent (so dropping on a sub-session places the dragged item as a sibling under the same parent). Multi-select is supported (`canSelectMany: true`). 2-level safety guard prevents drops that would exceed the depth limit.
- **Custom group ordering** — Groups can now be reordered the same two ways as sessions: (1) right-click a group header → "Move Group Up" / "Move Group Down", (2) drag a group header onto another group to insert it right before. Group order is persisted by rewriting the `claudeSessionGroups` object with the new key order (modern JS engines preserve non-integer-string key insertion order).

### Changed
- **Session icons — titled vs untitled** — Titled sessions (with a user-assigned name) use `comment-discussion` (two overlapping speech bubbles). Untitled sessions use `comment-draft` (dashed-border bubble) so the two kinds are visually distinguishable at a glance. Removed the earlier `folder` override that rendered every grouped session identical to its group header.
- **Context value assignments** — Tree items now carry explicit `contextValue` strings (`session`, `subSession`, `customGroup`, `recentGroup`, `resumeLaterGroup`, `trashGroup`, `trashed`). Existing `moveToGroup` / `trashSession` menu conditions switched from negative matching to positive matching so they no longer leak onto group headers.

### Internal
- `SessionTreeDataProvider` gains `handleDrag` / `handleDrop` (for `TreeDragAndDropController`) and helpers `_getScope` / `_getSiblings` / `_writeSortOrder` / `moveSessionUp` / `moveSessionDown` / `setSessionParent` / `removeSessionParent` / `moveGroupUp` / `moveGroupDown` / `_reorderGroupsBefore` / `_writeGroupOrder`.
- D&D uses two MIME types — `application/vnd.code.tree.claudecodelauncher.sessions` (session items) and `...groups` (custom group headers) — so group drags can't accidentally act like session moves.
- New storage keys: `claudeSessionSortOrder` (integer map, sparse 10/20/30...) and `claudeSessionParent` (session→parent sessionId map). No migration needed; group order continues to live in `claudeSessionGroups` key order.

## [2.5.7] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **Fullscreen mode detection & indicator** — Claude CLI's new fullscreen mode uses alternate screen buffer + mouse reporting, which breaks text selection and other launcher features. The launcher now detects both `\e[?1049h` (alternate screen) and `\e[?100Xh` (mouse tracking) escape sequences in real-time and shows an amber "FS" badge in the toolbar. A one-time toast hint reminds the user that Shift+drag bypasses mouse capture for text selection.
- **Context menu works in fullscreen** — Right-click context menu listener switched from bubble to capture phase, so it fires even when xterm.js mouse reporting intercepts and stops propagation of the event.
- **Export warns in alternate screen** — When exporting from fullscreen mode, a toast warns that only the current viewport is captured (the normal buffer with full scroll history is not accessible from the alternate screen).
- **Scroll FAB auto-hidden in fullscreen** — The scroll-to-bottom button is suppressed in alternate screen mode since the TUI application manages its own scrolling.

## [2.5.6] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **Toast "열기" link after paste-to-file** — When a large paste is saved to a temp file, the notification toast shows a clickable `[열기]` link that opens the saved text file in the editor. Lets you verify exactly what Claude will see via the `@path` reference.
- **Toast "취소" link on attachments** — Both the text paste-to-file toast and the image paste toast now carry a red `[취소]` link. Clicking it sends N DELs (0x7f) into the PTY to wipe the just-injected `@path`/image-path from the prompt and deletes the backing temp file, so the attachment never existed as far as Claude is concerned. Saves you hitting backspace N-hundred times. Caveat: if you've already typed prompt text after the paste, those trailing chars get erased first — cancel promptly.
- **Image paste thumbnail preview** — When a screenshot is pasted, the toast now renders a small thumbnail (max 96×64) of the exact bitmap that was captured, so a wrong clipboard (pasted the previous screenshot by mistake) is obvious before Claude sees it. Thumbnail is reused on the success toast, which additionally gets the `[열기]` + `[취소]` links.
- **TSV → Markdown preview in toast** — Conversion toast previously said only "TSV → Markdown 표 변환". It now reports dimensions, e.g. "📊 TSV → Markdown: 6행 × 4열", so a wrong clipboard is obvious at a glance.

### Fixed
- **Toast action links weren't clickable** — `#paste-toast` had `pointer-events:none` in CSS (so the toast wouldn't block terminal clicks under it). That also blocked the new `[열기]` link. Root fix: keep the toast non-interactive by default, but set `pointer-events:auto` on action links individually.
- **Idle 1s scroll polling removed (B4)** — `scroll-fab` visibility was driven by a 1-second `setInterval(checkScroll, 1000)` on every open panel, doing a DOM query even when the terminal was idle. Replaced with a direct `scroll` listener on xterm's `.xterm-viewport` element (attached once it materializes). Zero work while idle; identical behavior when scrolling.

### Internal
- `tryConvertTsvToMarkdown` now returns `{ markdown, rows, cols } | null` instead of `text`. Callers switched to explicit null check.
- `showToast(message, opts)` now accepts `opts.actions = [{ label, onClick, color? }, ...]` for multi-link rows; legacy `opts.action` still supported. New `opts.image` renders a prepended thumbnail. Toast auto-dismiss bumped 2.5s → 4s to give time to click.
- `paste-file-ready` / `image-paste-result` messages carry `fullPath` (native separators) alongside `cliPath`. New router cases: `open-paste-file` (routes to `vscode.open`), `cancel-paste-file` (unlinks the temp file).

## [2.5.5] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **Excel cell selection pasted as PNG instead of text** — Excel puts both tab-separated text AND a rendered PNG on the clipboard for any cell range. The v2.5.4 paste handler iterated `clipboardData.items` and caught the image entry first, which meant tabular data was silently uploaded as an image instead of kept as text. Paste now **prioritizes text**: if `clipboardData.getData('text')` returns anything, the text path runs (with optional TSV→Markdown conversion and the existing size-based paste-to-file threshold). Image handling only fires when there is no text on the clipboard (pure screenshots).

### Added
- **TSV → Markdown table auto-conversion** — When a paste is detected as a tab-separated table (≥2 rows with the same ≥2 column count), it is converted to a Markdown table before injection so Claude can parse it directly. Enabled by default; disable with `claudeCodeLauncher.pasteTableAsMarkdown = false` to keep the raw TSV. `|` characters inside cells are escaped as `\\|` to keep the table valid. Converted pastes are injected via `term.paste()` so xterm's bracketed-paste wrapping still applies.

## [2.5.4] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **Paste truncation — root workaround via `@path`** — v2.4.3's 256B/20ms chunked writes still lost bytes in prolonged large pastes because Ink (Claude CLI's TUI layer) runs its own line editor on top of ConPTY, and that editor drops bytes when reads can't keep up with writes over ~1–2KB. Chunking only lowered the rate, didn't remove the drop. Now when clipboard text exceeds `claudeCodeLauncher.pasteToFileThreshold` characters (default **2000**, set `0` to disable), the webview intercepts the paste, saves the text to `<os.tmpdir()>/claude-launcher-paste/paste-<timestamp>-<rand>.txt`, and injects `@<absolute-path> ` into the PTY instead. The CLI's `@file` reference reads the file directly, sidestepping PTY bulk-write entirely. No truncation possible because the PTY only sees a short path. Temp files older than 7 days are swept on each paste.
- **Export Conversation — transcript corrupted by terminal reflow (redone correctly)** — v2.5.2 tried to fix this by capturing raw `pty.onData` bytes and stripping ANSI, but Claude CLI is an Ink (TUI) app that expresses layout via cursor-move + partial writes, so blind ANSI stripping discards layout meaning and produces mangled text. Export now uses `term.selectAll() + term.getSelection()`, which runs through xterm.js's virtual-terminal state machine (already handles cursor moves, `isWrapped` line merges, and render state) and then trims trailing whitespace per line. Render output is now export output.

### Added
- **`claudeCodeLauncher.pasteToFileThreshold`** setting (default 2000, min 0) — 0 disables the paste-to-file behavior and restores direct PTY paste for all sizes.

### Removed
- `src/pty/rawBuffer.js` and related `appendRaw`/`resetRaw` hooks added in v2.5.2 (unused after switching Export to `getSelection`).

## [2.5.2] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **Export Conversation — transcript corrupted by terminal reflow** — Previously the transcript was reconstructed by iterating xterm's render buffer (`term.buffer.active.getLine(i).translateToString(true)`). Two failure modes stacked: (1) soft-wrapped long lines (e.g. a long URL warning exceeding `cols`) were split across physical rows and `\n`-joined, chopping one sentence into two; (2) Windows ConPTY live-reflows already-emitted lines when the terminal resizes, which could then collapse many logical lines into one very wide row padded with hundreds of trailing spaces — producing the wall-of-spaces blob users reported. Export now reads from a new **per-entry raw PTY capture** (`pty.onData` → `entry.rawOutput`, ring-trimmed at 10MB by whole lines) and runs it through a dedicated `sanitizeForExport()` that strips CSI/OSC/DCS escape sequences, collapses `\r\n` → `\n`, and resolves lone `\r` progress-bar overwrites by keeping only the text after the last `\r` on each line. Render state of the terminal no longer affects export fidelity.

### Internal
- New module `src/pty/rawBuffer.js` (`appendRaw` / `resetRaw` / `sanitizeForExport` / `MAX_RAW_BUFFER = 10MB`).
- `pty.onData` handlers in `createPanel.js` + `restartPty.js` call `appendRaw(entry, data)`; `restartPty` calls `resetRaw(entry)` when spawning the new process so a restart starts the raw transcript fresh.
- `handleExportConversation` signature changed from `(text, entry, panel)` to `(entry, panel)`. Webview no longer scrapes its render buffer; it just sends `{ type: 'export-conversation' }`.
- `entry.rawOutput` is in-memory only (not persisted to `sessions.json`).

## [2.5.1] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **`sessions.json` partial-write / cross-window race** — `sessionStoreUpdate` previously did `readFileSync` → mutate → `writeFileSync`, so two windows (or two flushes inside one window) flushing back-to-back could clobber each other's keys, and a crash mid-write left a truncated/corrupt JSON file the next launch couldn't parse. Writes now go through a `.tmp.<pid>.<ts>` file with `fsync` + atomic `rename`, and tmp files are cleaned up on failure.
- **Particle effect RAF kept burning CPU when disabled** — `animateParticles` re-scheduled itself via `requestAnimationFrame` every frame even when `particlesEnabled` was off, leaving an idle ~60 fps no-op loop running. Now the loop exits on disable, and both toggle paths (right-click "Particles" + slash command `toggle-particles`) restart it on re-enable.

### Removed
- **Dead `set-memo` message handler** — Router accepted a `set-memo` webview message that no client code ever sent (real memo flow is `request-edit-memo` → `showInputBox` → `memo-updated`). Removed handler + protocol comment.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-04-15

### Changed
- **Internal refactor — module split** — `extension.js` (4,386 lines) split into a thin 3-line entry + 23 modules under `src/`. No user-visible behavior changes. Structure only. Module layout:
  - `src/activation.js` — activate/deactivate lifecycle, command registration (10 commands under `claudeCodeLauncher.*`)
  - `src/state.js` — runtime state singleton (panels Map, tabCounter, statusBar, sessionTreeProvider, context)
  - `src/i18n/` — locale strings (en/ko) and runtime resolution
  - `src/store/` — session JSON persistence (`sessions.json`) + save/restore
  - `src/tree/` — `SessionTreeDataProvider` for the sidebar
  - `src/pty/` — `writePtyChunked`/`killPtyProcess`/`resolveClaudeCli` + `createContextParser()` factory (dedupes what was previously duplicated between createPanel and restartPty)
  - `src/panel/` — `createPanel`, `restartPty`, `messageRouter` (19 webview→ext types dispatched from one table), `statusIndicator`, `webviewContent`/`webviewStyles`/`webviewClient` (HTML/CSS/JS separated as JS modules; true static split scheduled for v2.6)
  - `src/handlers/` — toolbar, openFile (with partial-path recovery), openFolder, pasteImage, dropFiles, exportConversation, desktopNotification

### Fixed
- **XSS via innerHTML (pre-existing, hardened during refactor)** — Settings list renders for custom buttons / custom slash commands / file associations / slash menu concatenated user input directly into `innerHTML`. Added `escapeHtml()` helper and applied it at 5 injection points. DOM structure unchanged, string sanitization only.

### Internal
- Session schema (`sessions.json` keys and 6-field session object) unchanged — existing user sessions load transparently.
- Command IDs under `claudeCodeLauncher.*` preserved (legacy naming kept to protect existing `keybindings.json` bindings).
- `WebviewPanelSerializer` still not used — retained self-managed restore via `sessions.json` and activate-time `restoreSessions`.

## [2.4.3] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **Long paste truncation (recurrence)** — v2.4.0's `writePtyChunked` (1024B/10ms) still dropped bytes on Windows ConPTY under sustained writes, and concurrent `writePtyChunked` calls (paste + typing) could interleave chunks because each call started its own setTimeout chain. Now a per-entry write queue serializes all writes, chunk size dropped to 256B and delay bumped to 20ms for ConPTY buffer headroom, and chunk boundaries skip UTF-16 surrogate pair splits so emoji/astral chars don't corrupt.

## [2.4.2] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- **Open File — Windows default app not launched** — Two issues combined silently: (1) `vscode.env.openExternal(Uri.file(...))` on Windows/Antigravity didn't hand off to the OS default app, and (2) when users had explicit `fileAssociations` like `.xlsx→excel`, the code invoked `spawn('excel', [...])` which fails with ENOENT since `excel` isn't in PATH. Both paths now route through `cmd.exe /c start "" "<path>"` (with `windowsVerbatimArguments` so `cmd` sees the quoted path intact), deferring to Windows file association to resolve the default app. Added a spawn error listener so future failures surface as a warning toast instead of silent.
- **Open File — partial/mid-drag selection** — "Open File" now uses the same `resolvePathFragment` recovery as Open Folder (cwd → ancestors → home dir → platform roots), so mid-drag fragments like `Downloads\foo.xlsx` resolve correctly. Previously only the basename-search fallback ran, which couldn't reach files outside `entry.cwd` (e.g. `~/Downloads`) and silently failed with "File not found".
- **`~` expansion for Open File** — `~`, `~/foo` now expand to the home directory.
- **Directory-as-file rejection** — If the resolved path points to a directory, Open File now warns instead of attempting to open it as a file.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- **Open Folder — partial/mid-drag selection** — Context menu "Open Folder" now correctly resolves partial paths (e.g., mid-drag of an absolute path selecting `rockuen/obsidian/...`). Introduced `resolvePathFragment` which tries cwd → ancestors (walk-up) → home dir → platform roots (`/Users` on Mac, `/home` on Linux), accepting only paths that actually exist. Previously walked up to any existing parent and silently opened the wrong folder (often cwd).
- **Open Folder — lost selection on right-click** — Some environments (notably Mac Electron + xterm canvas) cleared the selection during `mousedown`/`contextmenu`, causing "Select text first" toasts even with visible selection. Now caches the selection at `contextmenu` time and falls back to it when live selection is empty.
- **`~` expansion** — `~`, `~/foo` now expand to home directory on Mac/Linux.

### Added
- **Open Folder — success toast** — Shows "Open folder: <path>" on success (parity with Open File).
- **Invalid path warning** — Shows "Cannot open folder (invalid or partial path)" instead of silently opening an unrelated ancestor directory.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-04-08

### Security
- **Command injection hardening** — Replaced all `exec()` with `execFile`/`spawn` + argument arrays (`killPtyProcess`, `showDesktopNotification`, `handleOpenFile`, `handleOpenFolder`, `readClipboardImageFromSystem`)
- **URL scheme validation** — `open-link` handler now rejects non-http(s) URLs (prevents `javascript:`, `vscode:` execution)
- **Windows path injection fix** — `openNative` uses `vscode.env.openExternal` instead of `cmd /c start` for untrusted paths

### Fixed
- **Long text paste truncation** — `writePtyChunked()` splits large inputs into 1024-byte chunks with 10ms intervals (ConPTY buffer overflow fix)
- **Stale PTY handler race** — Added `entry.pty !== thisPty` guard on all `onData`/`onExit` handlers to prevent old PTY exit events from corrupting new PTY state
- **Restart PTY robustness** — Kill old PTY before spawn, reset `_disposed` flag, debounce with `_restarting` guard, use stored `cols/rows` instead of hardcoded 120x30
- **Deactivate saves dead sessions** — Filter `!entry.pty` entries to prevent restoring finished conversations on reload
- **Null PTY guards** — `handlePasteImage`, `handleDropFiles` now check `entry.pty` before write
- **File descriptor leak** — `_extractFirstUserMessage` uses `try/finally` for `fs.closeSync`
- **Particle animation** — Skip render loop when particles are disabled (CPU savings)
- **CLI resolve timeout** — `execFileSync` with 1.5s timeout (was `execSync` 3s blocking)

## [2.3.7] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- **"Webview is disposed" errors** — Added `_disposed` guard flag and `try/catch` protection to all async `postMessage` calls (PTY `onExit`, `setTimeout` callbacks, clipboard `exec`). Cleared `runningDelayTimer` in `onDidDispose` to prevent stale timer firing.

## [2.3.6] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- **Clean copy (trim trailing whitespace)** — `getCleanSelection()` trims trailing spaces from each line when copying terminal text. Applied to Ctrl+C, context menu Copy, Open File, and Open Folder.

## [2.3.1] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- **Context usage parsing overhaul** — Comprehensive ANSI strip (CSI, OSC, 2-byte ESC, all control chars including CR/DEL), rolling 300-char buffer for cross-chunk pattern capture, optional colon in keyword regex (`컨텍스트:` format), broad fallback regex for resilient % detection

### Added
- **Inline group management icons** — Rename/Delete icons on custom group headers, Empty Trash icon on trash group header
- **Session group context values** — `customGroup` and `trashGroup` context values for precise menu targeting
- **Group rename command** — Rename groups with expanded state preservation
- **Debug logging** — One-time context buffer sample log for parsing diagnostics

## [2.3.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **Custom session groups** — Unlimited user-defined groups, QuickPick session move, "Remove from Group" to ungroup
- **Trash / Restore** — Delete moves sessions to trash folder, Restore brings them back, Empty Trash with confirmation dialog
- **Group collapse state persistence** — `onDidExpandElement`/`onDidCollapseElement` tracking, restored on refresh
- **i18n nls files** — `package.nls.json` (English) + `package.nls.ko.json` (Korean) for sidebar labels

### Fixed
- **`const projDir` duplicate declaration** — Reused variable in `_buildGroups()` for Trash group

## [2.1.6] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- **CLI resolution for npm installs** — Fixed "Cannot create process, error code 2" on Windows when Claude CLI is installed via `npm install -g`. node-pty cannot execute `.cmd` shim files directly; now wraps with `cmd.exe /c` automatically.
- Unified CLI path resolution into `resolveClaudeCli()` function (3-step: `~/.local/bin` → npm global → PATH fallback)

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **i18n support** — English and Korean, auto-detected from IDE language setting

  - Theme, font size, font family, sound, particles toggle
  - Custom buttons and slash commands management
  - Export/Import settings as JSON for sharing
- **Context usage indicator** — Toolbar progress bar showing token usage (click to refresh)
- **Custom slash commands** — User-defined commands in autocomplete dropdown via settings
- **Custom buttons** — Configurable input panel buttons via settings
- **Ctrl+C copy** — Copy selected text with Ctrl+C, send interrupt when no selection
- **CLI not found detection** — Shows install guide when Claude Code CLI is missing

### Changed
- Toolbar simplified — removed zoom, paste image, sound buttons (accessible via settings/shortcuts)
- Queue button unified — single button for add + run
- Slash commands genericized — standard CLI commands only, personal skills via custom settings
